# SmugBugArcade
A website with a variety of different simple JavaScript games on each page.

This is a website designed to get used to using JavaScript in a variety of a ways on webpages, so each of the minigames on it offer
different ways of interactivity for the user. It still has a ways to go before the site has reached its first stage is completed.
At the moment the games Rock Paper Scissors, Guessing Game, and Shooting Gallery are all fully functional, complete with statistic
tracking and full playability. Work still needs to be done to polish up each of these games, but for the most part I'm pleased with how
they turned out.

As for the future of this project, after polishing up each of those 3 games, I plan adding in Penguin Race, which is a simplified version
of the C++ game I made (with the added bonus of penguins animated by jQuery) and Tic-Tac-Toe. In addition, a simple About page that offers
explanation for the site needs to be finished, and I would like to make a profile page that keeps track of your scores as you move between
the different pages.

As usual, I included screenshots with my files so how the code looks running can be seen by those who aren't interested in running it
themselves. 

Update: 10/26/19: Added in a couple of fixes for the Shooting Gallery minigame, including better bounds for the targets and stopping
the creation of more targets after the game ends.
